# hello-world
my introduction to GitHub

I am starting my journey on becoming proficient with programming languages. Currently I'm learning C and I would like to master this before moving to Python and Java. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If there is a style that is more globally accepted, variable names to shy away from, or just shortcuts that improve coding please feel free to bring these to light.

Thanks in advance.
